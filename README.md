## Project Overview

Welcome to the Mall Customers Clustering project, where we leverage the K-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into customer behavior. This project involves data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization techniques to identify meaningful customer segments.

## Key Features

1. **K-means Clustering Algorithm:** Utilized for customer segmentation based on age, annual income, and spending score.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored and analyzed customer data to understand patterns and trends.

3. **Outlier Removal:** Implemented IQR method to detect and remove outliers for accurate clustering.

4. **Feature Scaling:** Applied scaling to major columns, including 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score.'

5. **2D and 3D Clustering:** Conducted clustering in 2D for age vs. spending score and income vs. spending score, and in 3D for age, income, and spending score.

# K-means Algorithm Theoretical Explanation

The K-means clustering algorithm is a widely used unsupervised machine learning technique that aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets, or clusters. The primary components of the K-means algorithm include:

## 1. Centroids

A centroid is a central point within a cluster. In the context of K-means, it represents the mean position of all the data points in a given cluster. Initially, K centroids are randomly placed in the feature space.

## 2. Clusters

Clusters are formed by assigning each data point to the centroid that is nearest to it. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective centroids. The assignment process is repeated iteratively until convergence.

## 3. Iterations

The K-means algorithm proceeds through a series of iterations. During each iteration, the following steps are performed:

   a. **Assignment Step:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming clusters.
   b. **Update Step:** Recalculate the centroids based on the mean position of data points in each cluster.

The iteration continues until convergence, which occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly between consecutive iterations or when a predetermined number of iterations is reached.

## 4. Cluster Formation

1. **Initialization:** Select K initial centroids either randomly or using a specific initialization method.
2. **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
3. **Update:** Recalculate the centroids based on the mean position of data points in each cluster.
4. **Iteration:** Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence or a specified number of iterations.
5. **Result:** The final clusters represent distinct groups of data points, and the centroids define the central positions of these groups.

K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, and the choice of K is a crucial parameter that significantly impacts the clustering results. The Elbow Method is often employed to determine the optimal K value, balancing cluster granularity and overall model simplicity.

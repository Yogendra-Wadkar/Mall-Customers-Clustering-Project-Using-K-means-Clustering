# Project Description

## ðŸ“‹Jupyter Notebook File Data

### 1. Importing Libraries

The project begins with the essential step of importing libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. These libraries lay the foundation for data analysis and clustering using the K-means algorithm.

### 2. Problem Statement

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about mall customers, including ID, age, gender, income, and spending score. The objective is to apply the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their behavior and spending patterns.

### 3. Data Gathering

Data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv` function. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, adding context to the mall customer characteristics.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset using key functions:

### 4.1 Checking Columns (`df.columns`)

This function provides an overview of the columns present in the dataset, aiding in understanding the variables available for analysis.

### 4.2 Dataset Information (`df.info()`)

The `df.info()` function offers details about the data types, non-null counts, and memory usage, providing insights into the dataset's structure.

### 4.3 Descriptive Statistics (`df.describe()`)

Utilize `df.describe()` to generate descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the distribution.

### 4.4 Missing Values Check (`df.isnull().sum()`)

Identify and quantify missing values in the dataset using `df.isnull().sum()`. This step is crucial for handling or imputing missing data effectively.

Gain insights into the structure, characteristics, and identify potential missing values in the data.

## 5. Feature Engineering

Enhance the dataset through the following feature engineering steps:

### 5.1 Handling Outliers

Implement the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and handle outliers. The custom function (`Finding_outliar1`) specifically targets outliers in the 'Annual Income (k$)' column.

### 5.2 Scaling

Apply scaling to 'Age,' 'Annual Income (k$),' and 'Spending Score (1-100)' using appropriate techniques. Scaling ensures compatibility with distance-based algorithms like K-means, contributing to the robustness of the model.

## 6. Model Training

Apply the K-means algorithm for 2D clustering based on age and spending score, 2D clustering based on annual income and spending score, and 3D clustering on age, annual income, and spending score.

### 6.1 2D Model 

Create a variable `x` representing the features for 2D clustering. Utilize the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). Visualize the resulting clusters through scatter plots.

### 6.2 3D Model 

Generate a 3D scatter plot depicting clusters formed by the K-means algorithm on age, annual income, and spending score. Evaluate clustering quality using inertia and silhouette_score.

## 7. Final Note

The project concludes with a summary of the analysis of mall customer data, insights gained through clustering, and the potential for designing effective customer acquisition strategies. Feedback on the notebook is welcomed, fostering a spirit of continual exploration and learning in the field of data science.

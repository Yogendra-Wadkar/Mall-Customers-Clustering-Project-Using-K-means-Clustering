# 6. Visualization Summary

## 6.1 Simple Scatter Plot for 2D Dimensions

The application of a simple scatter plot in the exploratory phase serves as a visual representation of data points in a two-dimensional space. This plot assists in identifying patterns, clusters, or outliers within the dataset. The x and y axes represent two features, offering an initial glimpse into the relationships.

## 6.2 Elbow Method Graphics for Gilbert Method

The Elbow Method is a critical step in determining the optimal number of clusters (K) for K-means clustering. It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against different values of K. The point where the rate of decrease sharply changes, resembling an elbow, signifies the optimal K. This graphical plan guides the selection of an appropriate cluster number for subsequent analysis.

## 6.3 Scatter Plot for 2D Clustering based on Age and Spending Score

Following the application of the K-means algorithm, a scatter plot is employed to visualize the clustering results based on age and spending score. This graphical representation offers insights into the segmentation of customers, providing a clear depiction of distinct clusters.

## 6.4 Scatter Plot for 2D Clustering based on Annual Income and Spending Score

Similar to the previous scatter plot, this visualization focuses on clustering based on annual income and spending score. The plot aids in understanding the distribution of customers within the dataset, revealing potential patterns and groupings.

## 6.5 3D Clustering: Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score

A three-dimensional scatter plot is generated to visualize the clusters formed by the K-means algorithm on age, annual income, and spending score. The inclusion of the third dimension enhances the representation of complex relationships within the data, providing a comprehensive view of the customer segmentation.

These visualizations contribute to a deeper understanding of the data distribution, cluster formations, and the effectiveness of the applied K-means algorithm.
